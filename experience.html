                ## Work Experience

### Digital Marketing Apprentice
**Google** | Gurgaon, India | Mar 2024 - Present

At Google, I wear multiple hats: content creator, event marketer, campaign strategist, and customer advocate. Here's what I've accomplished in 1 year 8 months:

**Built Brand Voice Through Content**
* I created LinkedIn content for our New Business Solutions team, establishing thought leadership and driving engagement. 
* Closed my first $15K deal within 3 months (and several more after that)
* Generated 300+ qualified leads contributing to $3.2M regional pipeline
* Supported growth for 100+ brands through strategic campaign recommendations

**Became the Event Marketing Go-To Person**
Planned and executed client activation events from scratch—built micro-sites, coordinated with agency partners, managed stakeholder expectations. Result? Consistently high client satisfaction and strong lead generation.

**Saved Money, Created Systems**
* Resolved critical client issues that prevented $20K-$100K in quarterly revenue loss
* Built an internal onboarding portal that reduced new apprentices and Nooglers ramp-up time by 15%
* Analyzed 1,000+ global campaign accounts to inform APAC's new vertical launch

**What This Experience Taught Me:**
How to blend data with storytelling. How to manage stakeholders when everyone has different priorities. How to create marketing that actually drives business results, not just vanity metrics. And most importantly—how to move fast and ship things in a complex organization.

**Tools & Skills Used:** Google Ads, Google Analytics, Campaign Management, Event Marketing, Content Strategy, Stakeholder Management, Data Analysis

                       ### Founder & Content Marketing Lead
**Tamiltoddlers** | Remote | June 2020 - Present

**The Challenge:** Tamil-speaking parents wanted to teach their kids their mother tongue, but quality resources didn't exist. Everything was either too academic, too boring, or in English.

**What I Built:** A content brand that became the go-to resource for Tamil language learning. Starting with zero followers and zero budget, I grew Tamiltoddlers to 5,000+ engaged followers across multiple platforms.

**The Strategy:**
* **Content First:** Created 200+ pieces of content (videos, graphics, worksheets, podcasts). Published consistently for 3+ years.
* **Data-Driven Iteration:** Discovered story-based content got 3x more engagement than traditional lessons. Pivoted entire strategy around this insight.
* **Multi-Channel Approach:** YouTube for long-form educational content, Instagram for daily engagement, podcast for parents' commute time, blog for SEO.
* **Community Building:** Responded to every comment. Built relationships. Turned followers into customers.

**The Results:**
* 📈 **5,000+ Followers** (4K on YouTube, 4k+ on Instagram)
* 💰 **100+ Paying Customers** (converted through content trust)
* 🌍 **International Reach** (customers in USA, Singapore, Norway)
* 💪 **4x Revenue Growth** in first year
* ⭐ **4.7/5 Customer Satisfaction**
* 🔍 **22,000+ Monthly Website Impressions**

**What I Learned:** How to identify market gaps. How to build an audience when you have zero budget. How to turn engagement into revenue. And most importantly—that great content marketing isn't about going viral, it's about showing up consistently and solving real problems.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Content Marketing, Social Media Strategy, Community Building, SEO, Customer Acquisition, Brand Building, Video Production, Copywriting, Analytics

**Marigold International School** | Bangalore, India | Jan 2019 - Mar 2024

This might seem unrelated to marketing, but teaching 33 five-year-olds every day taught me skills I use constantly:

**Communication:** How to explain complex ideas simply (try teaching alphabet to someone who can't read yet!)

**Stakeholder Management:** Managing parent expectations is harder than managing clients. Parents are emotionally invested. Sound familiar?

**Event Marketing:** Organized Annual Day, Sports Day, and parent orientations—essentially marketing events that needed planning, promotion, and execution.

**Content Creation:** Developed engaging educational activities that held attention (if you can keep 33 kids engaged, you can create content that converts).

**Key Achievement:** Scaled my classroom from 15 to 33 students while maintaining quality—a 120% growth with limited resources.

This experience taught me: empathy, patience, creative problem-solving, and how to present information in ways people actually understand.

### Marketing Analyst Intern
**MyTVS** | Chennai, India | Jun 2014 - Jul 2014

**The Context:** This was during my MBA, and I wanted to understand how marketing actually works in the real world. MyTVS gave me that opportunity.

**The Project:** Analyze which marketing channels generated the best leads across 4 retail locations. Was it tele-calling? Direct sales meetings? Digital campaigns?

**What I Found:** Digital was underutilized. Their website was outdated, social media was inconsistent. But those channels had the best ROI potential.

**My Recommendation:** Optimize the website for lead capture, invest in social media with proper branding, and track everything properly.

**Why This Matters Now:** This was 2014—way before digital marketing was mainstream in India. I was already thinking about multi-channel strategy and data-driven marketing back then. It's not a career switch; it's been the thread running through my entire career.
